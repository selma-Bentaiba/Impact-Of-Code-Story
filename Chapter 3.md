Chapter Three  :


You put everything you took from the security room in a bag, you sure think that walking with a bag in a place like this will make you look suspicious, but that’s a problem you’ll think about later, now the cameras are disabled, and so you continue your way.
Just when you exit the room , you hear a sound of something approaching in the air ,then it appears , you freeze on the spot, it's a drone , with a camera !!! It stops in front of you
~~its the freaking end ,is it going to shoot me , that’s what I designed it to do, well  “the magic turns on the magician” like they say ~~
“I'm so gonna die” you don’t realize that you said it outloud, until you hear the sound of the walkie-talkie you took from the room
 “Relax bud, I'm the one who sent it” your friend says. You sag in relief and ask her why.
“Well after the struggle you went through in the security room with all that decoding, i thought i’ll send you a letter in a more efficient way, so here we are”
You grab the piece of paper attached to the drone and it flies away immediately.
“You're gonna wanna get the pen from the bag for this one” she says.
“Why on earth am I gonna need a pen” you say confused.
“Wellll you see, the door to the lower floors has a certain system” she says apologetically.
“Noooo not again, have mercy on me for once” you whine.
“Well what did you expect, every type of illegal is performed on this floor, they wouldn’t want anyone to escape. Anyways, I'll tell you everything that can help you.
There are three doors by the end of the corridor they lead to other corridors, two of them are filled with shooting drones, every 24 hours they change which two rooms to fill with those drones, they also change the color of the doors, and only a certain group of people are sent the updated color-”
“Well then you just have to tell me the color, i don’t see why my brain skills are needed here” you interrupt again.
“Well technically if it was another day i would, but  today when i hacked the system some problems happened, and when i tried to get the color, i got a whole list of colors, i think it’s the list of colors for the whole next two months or so, but good news since i worked here for so long, i kinda grew familiar to the pattern of coloring, i can give you the closest color of what i think is the right color, you have to find which color in that list is the closest one to it”
 [Insert first challenge ]


After finding what you think is the right color, you try opening the door very hesitantly, afraid that you will be shot down by drones, after all there is always a chance that you calculated something wrong.
~~okey i’m still alive, I don’t know if it's luck or I’m super good at this , but it's the right door, thank God ~~
You take a deep breath, relief washing over you as you are still in one piece. You start your way down a short corridor that ends with a flight of stairs, before you could scan them very closely you hear footsteps coming from downstairs, but before you let panic take over you, you remember that short before arriving to the door you passed by a room,  a lab or something - you are not sure, you weren’t paying too much attention- but it’s a room nonetheless, so you hurry back to hide.
The signboard next to the door indicates it’s a lab for “Animal experiments”.
You walk in and you take in your surroundings looking for a place to hide. It's a very big lab, filled with tanks and glass boxes with various kinds of animals inside, but that’s not what triggered your panic, the place is crowded !!!
~~i didn’t escape from one person just to be caught by all of this people~~
But the place was very noisy, no one noticed your arrival, even a man passed by you and didn't even acknowledge your existence. He is wearing a white apron, and is looking down at a paper murmuring to himself, in fact now that you noticed everyone is wearing those aprons. You remember that you fetched a similar garment from the security room and you think now is the best time to put it on, it will surely help you blend.
All of a sudden a tall man starts approaching you with a frowning face, your legs start getting wobbly with fear, afraid he might recognize you, you rush to another section of the lab.
 “What Am I seeing here !” you exclaim , amazed .
You see high glass tubes reaching to the ceiling with glowing fish swimming inside. As for the walls , they are stacked with glass boxes , some contain large spiders , others have dragonflies, chameleons …. and many other creatures that you have never seen in your life before .
You approach one of the boxes that contain a few small turtles , strangely enough they were climbing the glass very slowly yet it doesn't seem that it’s difficult for them, rather it seems to be a normal thing, yet you are so confused, last time you remember turtles couldn’t climb walls.
While you are drowning in your thoughts, the door opens and someone approaches you, you hear a weak voice say
“Amazing isn’t it ?”  your body went cold with dread , heart leaping into your throat .
The person standing in front of you is a short young man in his mid twenties , wearing medical glasses and a white apron as well .
You can’t talk out of panic . When the young man notices the question marks on your face , he says
“ Sorry for the intrusion sir . I didn’t mean to interrupt you . I am a specialist in the development of the bat spy micro plane . I think you’ve heard of this extraordinary invention “
~~okey, i need to act natural, he doesn’t seem to recognise me~~
“It is .. it is a legendary invention , and I am …” you look around and continue : “ wall climbing turtles specialist , you must have heard of me “ .you say with a fake smile, hiding your extreme tension .
“oh sure , yes , spider turtles , you are a genius .. but can you tell me the reason you are so fond of turtles, to most people, they seem like boring creatures?”
“Well , turtles can hold their breath so long , some can stay up to 7 hours under water, they also can perceive the magnetic field’s intensity and use it as their own GPS , but the most interesting thing is that they are very similar to humans genetically, so can you just imagine if we could give the human race some of their abilities, that would be phenomenal“.
“Wow , this is impressive ! Well, now I have to take care of my bats . Good luck  with your turtles“
“I have to do something important too, good bye” . you say as you rush outside.
You walk back to the door that leads downstairs, still amazed that you remembered those turtle facts that were given to you by that obsessed girl you met in college.
You continue your way down the corridor again,you make sure you are attentive to any trouble, and then you hear it, the sound of a drone…
~~oh my god, did they change the rooms already, am I gonna get shot now, no impossible, i can’t die now i've come so far ~~
You hear a sound coming from the walkie-talkie, and you pick it
“Are you calling me to tell me that the drones were let loose in this corridor and I'm gonna die, cause I already know that, I can hear it approaching-” you get interrupted.
“Hahaha, can’t believe that your heart stops everytime you hear a drone, no this corridor is still safe.
I think you forgot that i told you, i will be sending you help with a drone, didn’t you” 
“Oh right i forgot, still you could’ve warned me before, i’m all nerves here, i even had to hide in a lab because i almost got caught, excuse me if i’m a little paranoid about everything- wait i see a paper attached to the drone, don’t tell me i have to solve another thing…” you say, frustration building inside of you.
“Yepp my friend, exactly.
you know even with the door system, there is a chance out of three someone could open the right door,or someone from downstairs who isn’t supposed to come up will try to come up anyway, and to make sure none of this happens, they equipped the stairs with some traps”
“You could’ve at least told me that when I was in the lab, it would’ve been safer if I did my calculations there, than here in the middle of a corridor where anyone can find me anytime, and I have nowhere to hide” you say, grumpily.
“Emmm, yeah good idea, next time i’ll think about sending you a drone with sensitive information in a room full of people who might easily get suspicious” she says sarcastically.
“Fair enough” you sigh in defeat “tell me what to do”
