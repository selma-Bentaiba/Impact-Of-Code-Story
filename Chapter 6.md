CHAPTER SIX:


Now that you finally got a clear map of where you are headed,you start assessing your surroundings, you are in what looks like the hospital's garden, some patients sitting with their families, some just chilling by the lake all alone ~~ if only it was that normal for me~~ you sigh and proceed your way to the marquise.
while walking you start wondering ~~ how come i didn’t get hurt , that’s insane, can't believe that the enhancement has that much effect even when i'm at such a low level~~ , you look at your arms and you find a surprise , a bad one , they are almost all yellow , you look at your legs and it's the same thing, you sneak a peek in the lake to see your face and thankfully until now no yellow there .
~~I should disguise myself right now , or I will bring unwanted attention ~~ , you open the backpack and put some gloves on, the rest of your body is covered with the apron.
you take the compass from the bag to help you navigate easily with the map you established...

peeking from the glass windows outside of the restaurant, you can see people, eating and chatting , nothing suspicious ~~guess they haven't started searching here yet, good~~
As soon as you get in however, someone grabs your arm and starts guiding you in,your heart stops, you feel a knot in your stomach “ hey wait..wait”, you panic, trying to free your hand “ who are you.. what are you doing !!?” 
"calm down i'm a friend, Sizma sent me" the man said in a hushed voice, "now we have to hurry before someone catches us, the alarm was already rang everywhere"
as you're walking he starts murmuring to himself, "can't believe what they did to you" can't believe they stripped you from your happiness, you and Sizma used to be very happy, coming here everyday and sharing sweet moments"
he walks you down to the kitchen, and then down to what seems to be a hidden room
when you arrive, you proceed to thank the man, but he says something very strange to you before leaving "hey , don’t die buddy , you have a son to protect"
you don't have time to process it, when someone taps you in the back, you turn around and you meet her eyes- memories start flashing.
There was a light , a voice of a baby crying, you getting married, happy to get a job with your wife... it was a spiral of memories coming all at once so fast you lost your balance.
"Are you okay?" Sizma anchors you as your knees start giving up on you.
when you are steady enough to stand on your own, she lets go "you scared me for a moment" she says with a sigh, "we meet again" she goes in for handshake, when you tell her that you remember, you remember that she is your wife and that you have a child together, that you applied to work for commander Qub together… 
her face lights up and she goes in for a hug, and then she notices your hands as the gloves slip away.
“Oh my God , you are transforming so quickly !“
“I feel heavy too, “ you say.
“We have to finish this quickly then “ she says in a determined voice.
We have to work on the antidote now and finish it today .

challenge 1

The antidote is done , you put it in your backpack .
“So now we should get away from here before anyone catches us, here is the map of the tunnel we are going through” she says as she hands you the map, “ I will go first, you can stay here and keep guard while i open the door down there “
“i should go first, what if there were something dangerous “ you object 
“no , i will open the door that leads us to the tunnel and prepare it , you don’t know how to do that,  do you ?”
“no , I have no clue “ you sigh, still angry.
“okey than see you later “
you hug each other .Then she gives you an envelope and says “this is so important to keep it in your backpack we need it later … and … remember no matter what happens we should … we should protect our son , do you get it“
You nod and she disappears downstairs. 
While holding guard  you start snooping in the backpack to see what is left of the supplies you got from that room, you notice a ball wrapped in green, with the label  “ hit it to explode , very harmful” 
~~can’t wait to use that one~~.
You snoop around some more when you start feeling like Sizma is taking too long, so you decide to check on her. You go down there, and start whisper-shouting “Sizma!!”, no answer, ~~weird~~ but then you notice a silhouette a little far away, “ oh finally , I freaked out for a second ,took you so long”” and you start walking towards her.
When you get close enough, you halt to a stop, your heart skips a beat. It’s definitely not Sizma standing there, but a man that you know so well.
The man smirks with that arrogant expression of him “well well well , look who is here ! i really missed you brave young man “
You stand there still frozen, a dozen questions in your mind, for it is commander Qub talking to you…
“Where is she !” you shout.
“Oh my boy , your woman is a very reckless girl , she never listens to orders , she could’ve become a very popular scientist, but no, she is stubborn, and foolish, killing her wasn’t an easy decision“
“what did u do …you psycho!!” anger starts flooding in your veins, you stand up and give him a punch in the face with all the force you got, he fell with a surprised look, clearly he didn;t see it coming.
with a big smile the commander said while standing again “ you have some gut after all,and i see you still have some strength left , but you will end up just like your wife“ and he starts laughing his most venomous laugh.
All of a sudden three armed men entered the room, you take a look around for an escape way, and there you notice a bump on the wall, that’s clearly the entry to the tunnels
 ~~she succeeded in opening the door ~~,
and right next to it, is your backpack.
You start running towards it, but before making it , a hand grabs your leg, you fall to the ground, three guns in your face.
“ You think you are a hero , you are just a pity worker in my land , no one ever dares to break my rules , and for your wife” even if you can’t see his face, you can hear the smirk in his voice “she got what she deserves , and now it’s your turn “.
“i have one thing to ask for “you interrupt, already a plan forming in your head.
“hah , we don’t make any wishes here but go ahead , tell me ”
“i wanna die standing ”
“Hahaha, funny, at your last moments, you still think there is honor, what a fool, let him have his stupid wish”, he signals the guards to back away and give you room to stand.
You stand up slowly, and in a fast motion, you grab your bag, grab the green bomb and throw it at them.
and instantly there was fume all over the room, guns started shooting randomly, and you felt one bullet hitting your arm.
 everybody starts screaming
 “ my eyees are burning !”
 “my face!!“
 “ catch him !“
You jump into the tunnel and secure the door back in place so that no one can follow, there was barely room to crawl in the tunnel, you start going as fast as you can, the sounds of men disappearing.
 ~~let’s just hope they don’t know where the tunnel leads, or else i’m doomed ~~
After what you think is two hours of moving, you finally reach the end, you slowly poke your head outside to check the place, all you can see is trees everywhere, everything is quiet, only the sound of the breeze, you assume you are in the woods, you get out, and slowly start walking trying to figure out what to do next.
But after a five minute walk the soil starts changing to concrete, and you arrive to what seems to be a parking lot, there are electric cars everywhere 
~~greate a way to escape, all i have to do is steal one of those ~~
Except you don’t have the key to start the engine.
