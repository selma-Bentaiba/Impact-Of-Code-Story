CHAPTER 07


Once the car engine starts and you drive a little far away from the camp, you start feeling a little bit relieved that you finally got away. You look at your arm to try and assess the wound of the bullet but oddly enough you don't find a wound.

you start wondering ~~ is Sizma really dead? after all i didn't see her body ~~
 ~~ what should I do now? ~~
 ~~ Where is my son?~~

you begin to have a headache, the more you think, the more the memories come back to you and the more you wonder ~~ how did i get myself into this~~

you remember Sizma's last words "remember no matter what happens we should … we should protect our son , do you get it", and the letter she left you, you hurry and fetch it from the bag and start reading.

~~~~~~~
I decided to grab a pen and write you these few words,
if you are reading this letter it means that you are out of that hell of a place, don't worry i took things in hand to help you even if i'm not there with you, go find axios and flee the country.
Tell him that his mother loves and will love him, forever.
~~~~~

You park in the neighborhood that you used to live in with Sizma, still teary-eyed from the letter.

Once you are out of the car, you start walking towards the house when Halfway through, you realize it's a bad idea, and that surely that's the first place they will look for.

you still have Sizma's letter in your hand, you stare at it helplessly, not knowing what to do, but then you notice there is something written in the back of the letter, it's a phone number.
you quickly dial the number.
“Hello“  a woman answers, the voice is a little familiar to you but you can't put your hand on who this is.
"hello, I-I-" you don't know what to say, it would sound kinda stupid if you asked her who she is since you are the one who called.
"Is this miko ?" the woman asks.
"How do you know who I am" you ask suspiciously.
"Ohhhh, i thought you would never call" a sigh of relief escapes her mouth "i'm (name), Sizma's sister don't you remember me ? Sizma told me that you will call sometime this day"

relief washes over you ~~you really thought of everything didn't you~~

"axios is with me, i'll send you the adresse we are at" she hangs up almost immediately ~~i guess she didn't want the phone call to be traced to her, smart decision~~

you head directly to the adresse she left you, while you are running you notice that apart from your head the rest of your body is almost completely covered with yellow spots.
...
when you finally arrive, you ring the bell. As soon as the door opens you see a 20 year-old guy looking at you.
"axios~" you whisper and you launch yourself for a hug.
"Dad," he says and hugs you back very tightly.

you enter the house, give a quick hug to (name) and then tell them that they have to pack their things the fastest they can, so you all can escape before you get tracked here.

"but where is Sizma, and where are we going" she starts asking
"no time for questions, i'll explain everything later, promise"

"Waittt,before i forget, there is a letter Sizma left me and told me to give it to you, i honestly didn't understand anything in what's written, but here it is" she hands you the letter.

Miko looked at the sheet left by Sizma and quickly understood that it was a code that had to be deciphered.

[challenge 1 ]

"ok these are GPS coordinates, hurry up we have to get to there quickly"

As soon as you get out of the house, you notice that the house is surrounded by soldiers ~~too late to run away~~ "Shit, we're in trouble" you signal to axios and (name) to stay inside.
One of them starts a device and a projection, similar to a hologram appears, and commander Qub erupts “we meet again Miko, huh you really thought you could escape me" he said with his usual smirk.
 
"From what I understand your memory is back, but it's already too late, i already got you under my grasp, HAHAHAHAHA, but you know I think I have something else that you will like even more HAHAHAHAHA”. you see him grabbing someone by the hair, you look closely "Sizma"
"You really thought I was just gonna kill her HAHAHAHAHAHA, she is more use to me alive then dead".

you were holding yourself and trying to keep calm, until the exact minute Sizma appeared, but now full of rage, the only thing you see is revenge. you advance towards the soldiers who try to shower you with bullets but to no avail. you start killing them one after another. Mad with rage, you feel like you're starting to lose your mind, you start screaming.

you see axios coming towards you, for a moment you prepare to attack him, but thankfully before anything happens you go back to your senses. you look around and you see all the soldiers down.
you fall to the ground, not knowing what to feel in the moment, too many emotions at once.
but then you remember that none of you is safe if you don't get out of there, after all Qub can always send more soldiers, so you start following the GPS coordinates.

while you are driving, you start explaining the whole thing to (name) and axios.

You explain also -by a hypothesis that you and Sizma established-, once the yellow spots have reached your brain, you will no longer be in control of yourself.
"me and Sizma prepared an antidote, hopefully it'll work"

“Why not take it now? “ asks Sizma's sister. "I have something to finish first,"
...
once in your destination, you find an underground shelter,you descend, and find an entrance to a tunnel. you find another letter from Sizma, talking about the pain she felt experimenting on you, her grief and sadness that there was a chance she won't see the three of you ever again.
"At the end of the tunnel you'll find a basement that has supplies that will help you survive for long enough, until you figure out a solution" you finish reading the letter.

you look at axios to console him, when you notice something ~~oh shit, o shit no~~ yellow spots on axios' arms,paralyzed, horrified, you don't know how to react. you fall to the ground, you didn't know you could infect people, and know two people infected and one antidote, A choice must be made quickly.
you take (name) aside and tell her that you'll entrust the antidote with her so she can give it to axios.
"me on the other side i'll have to be the victim"
In tears, (name) raises the hem of her shirt. She was infected too.

After a few long silent minutes of despair, you two decide to knock axios out, (since you know he'll protest)and leave him the antidote, along with his mother's letter with instructions, and off you two go to die away from him.

you get out of there, you look at (name), and you start apologizing, when she cuts you off "it's not your fault, you didn't know, now go and finish what you have to do"
"thank you for deciding to give the antidote to axios, i know it wasn't an easy decision"

you part your ways, you take the car and go back to the tunnel that leads back to the hospital, you meet jesuf again in the marquise, thankfully they didn't catch him, they didn't suspect that he helped you escape.

you explain your return, and that you're planning to save Sizma as your last mission before you die, and without question he directly agrees to help.

"We have to know where he is hiding her" you tell him.
"we can hack to the camera system and find out where they are, that's less risky than attempting to to go in blind"

[challenge 2 ]

"finally we are in" jesuf says.

"Okay good, now where is that piece of shit" you say as you start examining the camera footage.
"oh here they are" he points at one of the screens "always the last floor, but good for us since i helped Sizma before i know all the security systems put in place, it'll be easy for us to go unnoticed" you hear him say but you don't concentrate with his words as you see something horrifying in the room where Qub is.

"Is that sizma in the tank, tell me that's not her" you say trying to keep calm as you see sizma in the same tank that you were in before.

"holy crap, that's her, but wait" he says in a hurry looking at the expression in your face " on the good side this means that they didn't kill her and we can actually save her"

looking at it that way you calm down a little, "okey, let's go now" you say as you two wear aprons so you can disguise yourselves.
...
Once inside the floor, you head directly to the room, pulling your guns in the way.

when you get there, you sneak a peek and you see Qub sitting next to the tank where sizma lays unconscious. you start towards the room, but a hand grabs you "and if it was a trap, we are outnumbered, we need a plan" jesuf tries to reason with you.

but you aren't to be reasoned with, you know you don't have much time left, you enter the room and point the gun at the commander "Release her immediately or I'll kill you!"

The commander raises his hands in the air. “Ah Miko, you came back by yourself, what a funny surprise, you saved me much time and energy”

"Release her now, Qub, and maybe I'll spare your life," you reply, glaring at him.

he begins to laugh, then suddenly you are held by two men who came out of nowhere, then you see a dozen surround the room.

"i tried to warn you" jesuf who is held by one of them, says struggling.

"how can someone be so stupid, this is the 4th time you fall in one of my traps, one could learn to be less reckless" he starts laughing,“You want me to release her? Well I'm done with her, she can go!" he says while approaching a table.

he clicks on a button and the tank empties, and sizma falls to the ground, you try to catch her but you are still immobilized.
she regains her senses and looks at you, you try to talk to her- a shattering noise reigns a heavy silence for a few moments. It was the sound of a bullet, directly in sizma direction, she falls immediately to the floor unmoving.

just like last time you lose control, and go on a killing spree. you first get rid of the two soldiers holding you . And run towards the commander who is trying to escape. Some of the soldiers try to riddle you with bullets while others try to get in your way but to no avail. you are unstoppable.

you end up grabbing the commander by the neck and you start squeezing with all your strength. The helpless commander tries to remove your hands from his neck but there is nothing to do, you are much stronger, after a while you let go sure that he is dead
 ~~what an irony i killed you with the strength you built in me~~

3rd person pov:
miko turns completely into a monster and starts infecting other soldiers as well,but unlike miko's slow process to becoming a monster, they turn so fast into creatures with an ape-like appearance.

jesuf understands that they were screwed, so he runs to the security room and launches the  "code white" alarm to evacuate the whole hospital, and he also closes every access to the last floor so that the infected wouldn't reach the lower floors and contaminate even more people.

but little does he know he underestimated the strength of those creatures.

They start forcing the doors open, and at some point they succeed and swarm downstairs, even the shooting drone system was of no use since bullets are of no use with them.

Thus, They scatter throughout the hospital and infect everyone, and thus an apocalypse starts.

Was it the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning?
