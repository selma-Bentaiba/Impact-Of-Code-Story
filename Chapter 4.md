Chapter four  :


As you are walking down the stairs, following the pattern you drew, you try to get some information from your friend
“You know, I never asked, who are you? And why are you helping me?”
“My name is Sizma, i’m one of the scientists responsible of your experiment” 
“Oh wait, you were there in the lab where i was held”
“Haha how do you think I put the screw driver inside your tank”
“What were you trying to experiment on me?” you ask.


“Well it started back in the days, scientists started to mix different animals’ DNA together to see if it’s possible to alter a DNA sequence, the experiments were going so well, they even made a glowing cat, by mixing it’s DNA with a jellyfish’s in 2011, when we saw these great accomplishments, and since humans are similar to some animals genetically, we decided to apply those experiments on humans”
“And why on earth altering someone’s DNA is a good idea” you can’t believe someone would actually think that’s a good idea.
“It’s actually a great idea, we could cure so many diseases that way, animals that were tested appeared to be more immune, even to AIDS, that”s a great leap in the science field” she says all excited “but of course everything is easy in theory” she sighs and continues “turned out dna reconfiguration and reconstruction had a lot of flaws, any wrong move and it can result in grave consequences, instead of curing a disease it can result in one, like cancer, parkinson’s disease, or body mutation”
“And let me guess, the experiments continued anyway” you say, starting to get angry
“We tried to find the most compatible human beings, and you were one of the top ones, everything was going smoothly, we had very good results, until…” she sighs “ until commander Qub wanted more, he didn’t care about creating a human immune to diseases, the only thing he cares about is making weapons, he ordered us to mix your DNA with weird creatures from the animal labs, he wanted to create a superhuman he can control to do his bidding, that’s when it all went south, your body couldn't handle the new modifications and it’s started growing weaker and weaker, we knew we failed, and that’s when i decided i should stop all this mess" Sizma finishes guiltily.
“What’s gonna happen to me now” you ask, really not wanting to hear the answer.
“Hold on, I think someone is here, talk to you later, and try to stay on the third floor, there is something very important you have to take before escaping for once and for all” she whispers, before the line gets cut.
You continue down the stairs and finally find the exit.


When you get out you are shocked to find what seems to be a normal hospital, patients in their rooms, doctors and nurses passing by, and everything seems very normal. You turn around and you notice that the door you just came from blends perfectly with the wall, only the people who know it’s there can locate it.
~~smart move, since it’s a normal hospital, they wouldn’t want any curious eyes on their illegal business~~ 
You continue your way, not knowing where to go, Sizma said to stay on this floor, so you start wandering around observing your surroundings, some patients with their families or their friends, some who appear to be sleeping or unconscious, doctors consulting some patient, just casual hospital things, little do they know what’s being fabricated upstairs.
You hear your walkie-talkie again “hi again, i don’t have much time, someone is looking around here i need to find somewhere else to hide, there is a lab in this floor, they keep there all the chemicals you’ll need you have to look for it”
“What am i gonna need chemical for, and where am i gonna find it” you ask, confused
“No time to explain, you're gonna have to calculate the number of the door to the lab, it’s the only lab that contains a special monitor that you're gonna need”
“Or i’ll just check every room until i find it, i don’t think this needs calculation”
“Yeah you could do that, except the cameras are back to work and it’ll look very suspicious if there is someone opening every room and peeking around , they’ll find out about your escape soon anyways, so try to be quick and stay low”
“But-” you start complaining.
“Sorry gotta go, before i get caught, and we are both doomed” she says, and the line goes silent once again.
[insert new challenge]
You’re headed to the lab,and as you’re walking, a nurse and a man in a wheelchair pass by you, the old man yells in a troubled low-voice : “ it's no honor to keep me here ! Where is my will ? how can you continue with those … those … ah ah … “
the nurse injects something in the patient’s arm then looks at you :”don’t worry doctor, he is just having one of his episodes, this will calm him down a bit ”
For a second you are confused why she called you doctor, but then you remember you are still wearing the apron.
The nurse seems to recognize the brand in your hand that indicates you are a lab experiment. She is about to scream for help but the man in the wheelchair quickly injects her with what was left from the syringe. Standing there confused, you ask the man why he helped, and why was he still conscious while the nurse immediately fainted.
”I was once a successful molecular re-enhancing experiment , which means no drugs have an effect on me. This includes some-stuff like the ability of being vulnerable to viruses , disease, toxic food or dangerous UV lights, this syringe has a potion inside that is very very strong, but all it can do is weaken me, to keep me in check” The old man answers with a troubled voice.
Realization hit you: “I.. They did this to me too, the experiment, i,  too am an experiment of gene enhancement”
The old man looks very surprised: “it pains me to know that they are still experimenting… hmmm … look you have to run away as fast as you can from here, and never look back again, those experiments have been a mistake since the start”
“But I have so many questions, and I certainly can’t leave you here” you say, insisting.
“Look young man, this floor is full of cameras, and by now they surely saw me do the nurse and they are coming, they’ll never let me go but you might have a chance” he says, as you hear footsteps coming toward you. You start walking away afraid someone will catch you before you escape.
You think about running but that’s just gonna make everything more suspicious, so with a hurried pace you head to the lab.
As you enter you make sure the door is locked, and you slide a table across it as an extra precaution.
“Hello ? Hello Mi….ko… you here??” you hear Sizma’s voice from the walkie talkie.
“yess hello ! am in the lab now”
”what happened downstairs, talks about an unconscious nurse and patient in a wheelchair are all over the place, did you do something???”

“I didn’t do anything i just walked by them, the nurse seemed to recognize my brand but before she could do anything the patient in a wheelchair injected her with something,  he is actually an old man who've been through the same experiment as me, except his was consensual, and successful, you didn’t tell me that there were some successful experiments  ”
”Oh you have met the old Commander Jesuf Yes he looked like a successful one at first, he was the first one to start the labs upstairs, we all thought that it was going well, but it was affecting his brain slowly, this is why he is kept here.
Poor man, he was a hero, he even received the purple heart for Bravery and Courage, also open the door would you… i’m trying to sneak the drone inside so i can help you”
As you slide the table back again to unlock the door you ask “how was he a hero if he is the one who started it all, also why would he help me escape if that’s the case?? ”
“He had to close a radioactive valve, it’s something no human can do, even hazmat suits were useless, only he could do it since he can be exposed to those radiations, closing it saved many lives. I think the reason he helped you, is because all he wanted was saving people, he didn’t intend for the experiments to be as harmful”
After making sure the door was closed again, you start looking around. The lab had shelves and shelves of what looked like different potions, and tonics of different colors and textures. You go to pick a glass container with a pale-greenish yellow liquid inside it when-
“Hey!! Becarful there, some of these are poisonous, at least read the labels before picking something up” you hear Sizma’s warning, as the drone gets closer “oh my friend, this is Chlorine trifluoride, you picked a very poisonous, very dangerous one, this one here is very reactive, it even burns on water”
“Burns on water, that's crazy!!” you exclaim, as another jar catches your attention, this one is orange “what about Thioacetone is it safe ?” you ask as you read the label.
“Oh that one,it’s not really harmful, but god it smells terrible, one of the worst-smelling chemicals that ever existed” she says in a disgusted tone.
You open the jar to see how bad it could be, as soon as you do it you regret it, you start coughing all over the place, it was indeed the worst smell ever, you close it and put it back quickly.
You see a large container that has Hydrogen gas written on it “at least i know that one isn’t harmful” you say confidently, and you hear Sizma chuckle.
“hahaha , you wish, if you open that container now, the lab will explode. Hydrogen gas is very reactive to oxygen.
But since we don’t want that to happen, anddd we still have things to do here and then escape quickly, i say we better stop messing with the elements and concentrate on making an antidote for you”
~~Oh so this is what i am doing here, making an antidote for myself ~~
