Chapter five :

With a burst of joy and pride you shouted "Sizma it worked!!".

 "I know how to make the antidote but it will take a lot of -Antivenoms-  And from what I can see we only have enough for one dose, we mustn't miss”.
"No, what you've just seen is how to make part of the antidote, I'm taking care of the other part. We'll have to meet to put the two parts together to get a complete dose " answered Sizma
She continues "we don't have much time left, we have 15 minutes before the guards return. You will have to  monitor the percentage of advancement of the experiment and remove the chip that you have in the back of your right ear"
 astonished you touch your right ear and you feel a small bump, you rub it a little and you feel something solid bathed in a liquid. "Who did this to me? What is it for? And how do you even know about it--" 
you get cut off by Sizma "I know about it of course since I'm the one who placed it-Don't panic, I'll explain , once you step out of the hospital they’ll be able to track you with the chip, it has some magnet fields that can easily be tracked, we did it so we can  monitor your advancement in the experiment, this is why now you have to monitor it for the last time before taking it off, so we can know at what level you are ”.  
Your head hurts,and you feel something strange on your wrists, and you notice greenish yellow traces, then you notice them everywhere on your body. You don't know what to do anymore, you start to panic, you hear Sizma's voice in the background but you don't give it much thought.
You start to feel heavy, and you let go, you feel weak, you have no more strength, the only thing you want to do is to sleep… 
Through a blurry vision, you see the old man from earlier crawling towards you. He starts shaking you a little, so that you regain your senses.
You feel a sudden pain that disappears almost immediately . You come to your senses, and you hear the old man saying "this reminds me of old memories, you are already crumbling down-” you hear footsteps,”Quick kid, go ahead! You don't have much time left, I'll hold them off".
Without thinking too much you do so, and not much later you hear Sizma's voice again. 
"You fool, don't do that again, I got scared! What happened?"
“I-”

 "You must quickly go to the room of the devices. It is downstairs to the right, there, you will make the first part of the antidote and remove the chip" she cuts you off.
You move forward at a steady pace, you don't worry about being spotted because this corridor is empty since the only way to access it is through the lab and commander Jesuf is holding the guards . You try to enter but of course. There is another password. You are about to try a password when a man in a uniform that looks like the ones on the top floor comes up to you, ~~it’s a fool move to assume that there weren’t any guards~~, but he doesn’t seem to recognise you“I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid you've made a mistake. You don't have access to this room”.
"Ah, sorry, I thought it was a bathroom" you answer,and as soon as you look at each other,his face changes. You understand that he recognized you and immediately you pass to action and you choke him with one of the gasses that you took from the previous room.
You use his fingerprint and finally enter the room. You hide the body of the guard inside and start to inspect the different devices at your disposal. When a drone appears out of nowhere and scares you. “The red monitor is the one you are gonna use”

“Wow, that’s a very low level”, you hear Sizma say in a worried voice, “last time we checked it was 57%, it’s dropped so fast”
“And what does that mean exactly” you are not sure you wanna hear the answer.
“Wellll, I'm afraid if it keeps dropping this fast instead of going back to 0% which is the normal state of a human being-no enhancement-, it'll drop under that and you’ll become less and less of a human…”  Silence befalls you two, as you think of this horrible situation. “You know what is worse”, she continues “i’m not sure the antidote is gonna work”
“hahaha..”, you laugh sourly “why am i even trying then, i should let them kill me, that would be more merciful”
“You have to, maybe it’ll work, it’s worth trying” she says desperately.
You start preparing the antidote, determined to at least try to get rid of your misery… 
You finish the preparation, you don't know if it's good or not, but you're sure you followed the instructions and didn't miss anything. 
You pierce the back of your ear and remove the chip, then you break it with a hammer you found nearby.
"That's GOOD, I'm done" 
You hear Sizma answer you "Great! We can finally meet again". 
Feeling a little better that at least something is going right, you answer "where do we meet?" 
you didn't have time to finish that you hear Sizma shouting "Shit, he's back. We have to escape from here. Come quickly to the marquise”.
"What? Where is the marquise? And who is back already?" you wonder. "I forgot that you lost your memory,i’ll send you a map" as soon as she says that you hear a loud alarm ringing throughout the building. You go out to the hallway, then you join the main aisle upstairs and suddenly the neon lights that are usually white turn red and keep flashing.


A cold and robotic voice of a woman keeps repeating "Emergency maximum degree, Emergency maximum degree". You shout, in the walkie-talkie "HEYYYY, Sizma WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE" but she doesn't answer anymore, when suddenly you realize that it's absolute panic in the hospital nobody understands what's going on. The patients in their blue outfits rush to the elevator and others rush to the stairs. The doctors and nurses standing still in front of such chaos not knowing what to do.
Only that in the midst of the chaos, a soft, feminine voice spoke up: "Everyone, calm down. There was an incident on the last floor of the building, but nothing serious, we apologize for the mess." The lights returned to their original state and a heavy silence dominated the atmosphere. The doctors and nurses also regained their composure and began to restore order in the hospital, but you noticed a new presence, agents in black suits were now blocking access to the stairs and elevators.
 Quickly and before you gain their attention, you round a corner and enter a room, At first sight, and as expected it is a rather simple patient room. Different types of appliances occupy this room, you block the door with one of the devices. As you walk towards the balcony you notice an old woman on the bed, you bend down to have a look at her but she seems to be asleep. You exclaim, laughing, ~~well, if after all of that she is still asleep, that’s one heavy sleeper~~ and then you sigh, and continue towards the balcony, you take a look and you notice indeed that you are on the third floor. You look for a way to go down, because you know very well that it is not possible to go out normally anymore and that you have to go to the marquise quickly.
 You notice that each floor has a balcony, which seems quite complicated but not impossible. You take a deep breath and then position yourself so that you are holding on to the blue bars of the balcony with both hands, head against the wall and feet in the air. You tilt your body backwards and forwards to get some momentum, soon enough You jump and you are on the second floor
You get up, you raise your head, and a woman starts screaming at your sight. You prefer not to think about it and quickly, you position yourself again, you jump again to the first floor. You fall with your back on the bar of the balcony, you try to steady yourself but you slip and you fall and hit the ground head first. But when you get up, you realize you don't seem to be hurt, nor do you feel any pain. And you run away fast, watching a group of the black suit agents arrive at the balcony that you were in moments before.

You quickly find a corner to hide. 
~~now i have to figure out a way to go to the marquise~~
