Chapter two:

 You finally succeeded in reading the map and finding the right way to reach the security room.
while you are headed there, many thoughts find their way into your head :
~~ It has been a long while since I saw sunlight~~
 ~~What am i doing here in the first place,  what a nasty place ~~
~~oh I wonder who is guiding me through this mess , and why is she even doing this ~~
~~how can I trust her , well thinking about it , it is my only option ~~
~~… what about the freaking transparent liqu…. ~~

Suddenly your train of thoughts gets interrupted by faint voices coming not far away ,
you start to tremble, your heart beats increase.
To your luck, instead of getting closer to you the sounds appeared to be more distant which indicates that they are going in the other direction. you still try to eavesdrop -who knows maybe you’ll get some useful information-
“ Commander Qub , we have to collect new lab rats , one person won’t suffice for these experiments , sir !” says the same person with the shaky voice you heard in the lab talking to commander Qub, you assume that it’s his assistant since he seems to always be around him.
 “You told me we will get results in two days , you idiot ! “ always with his cold voice.
 “His body is too weak to handle another potion, he may die in a month or less”
In a sharp, frightening voice, commander Qub says “ That wicked ungrateful wimp ,I will order to kill him this week.
If it wasn’t for his disobedience , we would have been able to reinforce the security system , we would have finished building the great robot 
 It was an amazing project . We could have taken the whole country !!  Anyway , his body is useless now , it’s sad that he refused to complete his work , what a fool !“ 

Silence spreads in the air , all you can hear is footsteps of people moving away from the place .
You gulp hardly , your heart starts beating so fast you can feel it coming out of your chest, your forehead sweating .. you can’t believe what you heard, they surely were talking about you, about KILLING YOU !!
~~ if i get caught i won’t be taken back to the tank, they’ll literally kill me.I have to get out of here as soon as possible~~
you continue on your way before the worst could happen. Few hallways later, you find the door of the security room.
“ Finally, at least something went well“ you sigh with satisfaction.
However as soon as you start pushing the door , it makes a faint ringing sound, declaring : 
 ” Enter the password “ .
“ What !! , another password !!.. well i’d be a fool to think that the security room would be easy to crack, it might not be as easy as I think after all “ .

You hear a click and the door opens ,you hurry inside and close it behind you.
It was much bigger than you imagined , numerous surveillance monitors , many keys connected to the screens, and in the corner there is a small door written on top of it in bold red  “ Do not enter “
~~ Damn this room monitors the whole floor~~
But you can see that the screens are frozen, just like your friend promised.
~~ I guess i can call her my friend, after all she is helping me~~
And as you look around the room , something shiny catches your eyes. You try to get close to it , and it’s……
“ It’s your first day here “ a memory flashes .  
“ You have manifested a great lot of skills on everything that has to do with robotics, in fact we heard that you‘re the best in this field, this is why you were brought here, you will be in charge of the robots , newcomer. You will manufacture security ROBOTS . It will be a tough mission , so work hard , there’s no turning back here, we count on you “ 
“ Yes sir ! I will do my best ! “
 ~~an armored security robot !!!! i was building robots in this place, well at least now i remember why am i here, i just need to remember what happened that i went from building a robot to being a lab rat  ~~



You approach it , and you start analyzing the details. It is covered in dust and you notice the marks around the chest, they are either burn marks or explosion marks…
You are on your way to commander Qub’s office to ask him about some features you wanna add to the robot. When you get there you hear the commander say 
“Hahaha, he really thinks that he is here for a nobel reason, i can’t believe he still thinks the robots he is making are for security, if he realizes that we are preparing to control other countries with them he will lose his mind”
“Then he won’t realize” you hear whoever is with him say, and they both start to chuckle.
You remember after hearing that you rushed back to your robot prototype that was almost ready at that time, you did some modifications to make it explode and ruin the whole project, you also remember that you tried to run but were caught before you could make it.
All of a sudden , a sound came from a nearby computer . you stand up aghast and slowly approached it,
“ Careful buddy, don’t lurk too much here” relief washed over you when you realized that it was your friend talking “thankfully the guard left before you showed up or else that would’ve been a problem, i think he realized that the cameras were frozen and he went to fix the problem, this my friend gives you only so much time to get out of this room, or else-”
“I know we will have a problem,got it” you interrupted.
“Okey good, now i’ll send you a list of the things that you have to fetch from this room, believe me you’ll need them in the future”
