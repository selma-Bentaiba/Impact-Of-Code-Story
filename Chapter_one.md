Chapter one: 
It’s dark, all void, it feels like your body doesn’t exist at all, you’re trying to remember who you are or at least who you were … all you can remember is that your name is Miko, you force yourself to move but nothing happens… Suddenly you hear voices faintly talking
“The subject vitals are stable , all signs are green... Success rate 55%” 
-“excellent, start the injection”
……..
Sounds of loud machines pull you out of your deep slumber and finally you open your eyes,you find yourself in what seems to be a big glass tank and all your body is attached to long tubes filled with a strange blue liquid entering your body, suddenly you feel like  thousands of knives are piercing your body, you have never felt pain like that, your grunts and screams echo around all your surroundings..
After a few moments the machines stop and as the pain is fading you start hearing the same voices talking in a distance, you try to see who it is but your muscles are still processing the wave of pain that just hit you, and so you go back to lying down.
“No critical damage sustained, cells enhanced by 3.74%” you hear someone say,in fact you are not sure if it was someone or something because it sounded like a computer.
“We need more results otherwise by the end of this year we will have no more funds for this project, our partners are starting to doubt this will ever work, start the injection again” you hear a very cold and commanding voice say.
“If…I may  ...Commander Qub the subject may not resist another injection, and we had quite good results from last time. If you give us some days to tweak the serum more I can assure you our results will improve threefold” the first person replied with a shaky voice.
You hear what you assume now is commander Qub’s voice “2 days... it’s all you have, and I expect much more next time without having to remind you that your families’ lives depend on the project advancement”
“Yes …commander Qub”
The pain fades enough that you become more aware of your surroundings, so you try to peak again,you manage to see the room you’re in with 4 man in full white coats Anxiously packing their things, one of them slowly walks up to you and put his hand on the glass
“I’m sorry...so sorry it wasn’t supposed to be like this”
“Sizma you know the rules, we can’t talk to the experiments, and hurry up we have to go”, you hear someone from the other side of the room say.
She opens the tank and injects you with a transparent serum and as you start to feel heavy and sleepy you feel an object being put next to your arm, and everything turns dark…again…
You wake up to an empty room only filled with the faint lights, you start to move around and feel surprised as your hand collides with something, you turn your head and see a screwdriver, with the word “hit” carved on its handle, you pick it up, filled with rage you strike the glass a few times and cracks start to appear, you give it one good final strike and the glass shatters as you fall down with the liquid, you quickly try to reach for the exit and see near it a pc with “click” written beside it, you hesitate to click but then it comes to you that maybe the person who has written the word is the same person who left you the screwdriver ,so you proceed to click on it and a blue screen appears and you hear a voice say:
“If at least you remember anything about how it all started please trust me , I never thought it’ll turn out like this”, the voice is familiar but you can’t wrap your fingers around who it might be.
“For now we both have to get away, I’ll tell you everything when we’ll meet, for now I can only communicate with you through the voice system implemented on this floor…
this door leads to the central alley i left a map there hidden under one of the floor lamps, use it to get into the security room,I left there things that may help you, i also froze the cameras so you won’t be detected but i can only do that for little time, you have to be out of this floor by the time they go back to work.
Oh also, the door has a security protocol but you can override it, And please don’t forget to put clothes they’re in the closet to your right”.
 
[Insert challenge]
 
Having opened the door you step out and find yourself in a long corridor, gray walls with only some neon lights is all you can see, instinctively you choose to go right, after a dozen of feets you find a two way alley, you assume that you arrived to the central alley when you see floor lamps aligned in both sides.
There were at least a dozen, and the idea of having to look under each one to find the map already stressed you enough, but fortunately it was under the first lamp you checked, whoever this person who is helping might be, they sure don’t want you to waste time.
it’s a map of the 3rd and 4th floors, with some indications of the number of guards in each corridor,
You take your time to regain your composure and then you start reading the map:
~~ hmm seems I’m in the left section of the 4th floor, and the security room is … ? on the damn edge of the right side !!!, alright there are like 4-5 ways to get there, should I choose the shortest path? The most important is to avoid the most enemy possible, I can sneak around if there’s 1 guard, but that would be impossible with more ~~
